			<h1><b>Greenville Rising: How Local Partnerships Are Powering a Cleaner, Resilient City</b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 In the coastal city of Greenville, change is quietly unfolding through collaboration, innovation, and local leadership.
			 For years, the city faced the growing challenge of poor waste disposal, open dumping, burning, and the absence of structured
			 collection systems. Today, through the Sinoe Building Climate Resilience Project (SBCRP), the city is taking bold steps toward a
			 cleaner and more resilient future.<br>
				At the center of this transformation is a strong partnership between the Greenville City Corporation (GCC) and
				BASA Development Initiatives (BDI), with technical and financial support from Conservation International (CI) and
				the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The partnership recognizes that effective waste management is not just an
				environmental issue but also a matter of public health, youth employment, and local governance.<br>
			 </p><br><br>
			 
			 <h1><b>A New Kind of Local Partnership</b></h1>
			 <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 Following a rigorous selection process, Econtrak Solutions Liberia, a local enterprise, was chosen to manage the city’s new waste
			 collection and recycling efforts. Out of four applicants, Econtrak stood out for its clear operational plan, previous experience,
			 and commitment to community involvement. The company will work hand in hand with GCC to implement an efficient, community-centered
			 waste management system.<br><br>
				This collaboration marks a turning point for Greenville. The city, which has long struggled with open dumping and unmanaged waste
				sites, now has a structured plan to introduce sorting, collection, and proper disposal of waste. More importantly, the initiative
				will create jobs for young people and women, allowing the community to take ownership of its environment.<br><br>
			 </p>
			 
			 
			 <h1><b>Waste Management as a Path to Resilience</b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 The SBCRP’s waste management component is designed to link local solutions to national environmental goals.
			 By promoting cleaner urban spaces and building local enterprise capacity, the project is contributing directly to
			 Liberia’s ARREST Agenda – particularly under the pillars of Resilience, Environment, and Sustainable Growth.<br>
			 Cleaner communities are better equipped to handle the health and climate risks associated with flooding, pollution, and waste accumulation.<br><br>
				For the residents of Greenville, this partnership is more than a policy milestone; it’s a tangible change in how the city manages its future.
				The involvement of local actors ensures that waste management becomes a shared responsibility, not a top-down directive.<br><br>
				
				According to project reports, the Memorandum of Understanding between BDI and GCC has paved the way for immediate coordination and
				future scaling of the initiative. Econtrak Solutions Liberia’s engagement will also support data collection on waste volumes, types,
				and recycling opportunities, feeding into Liberia’s Natural Capital Accounting (NCA) system, an important national framework for
				tracking the value of environmental assets.
			 </p><br><br>
			 
			 
			 <h1><b>A Cleaner Future Begins at Home</b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			While the project is still in its early implementation stage, the community response has been encouraging. Residents and local
			youth groups have expressed willingness to participate in awareness activities and contribute to keeping Greenville cleaner.
			These local voices form the heart of SBCRP’s approach: empowering citizens to be part of the solution.<br><br>
			
			As one city official put it during a stakeholder meeting, “Greenville cannot be clean unless we all take responsibility for
			how we handle waste.” That sentiment now echoes throughout schools, households, and businesses, signaling a shift in mindset
			that could have lasting benefits.
			 </p><br><br>
			 

			 <h1><b>Beyond the Bins - Building a Model for Liberia</b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			What is happening in Greenville could serve as a model for other Liberian cities facing similar environmental pressures.
			The project’s inclusive approach, combining private enterprise, local government, and civil society, is demonstrating that
			sustainable waste management is possible when everyone plays a role.<br><br>
			
			BDI’s continued engagement with the City Corporation, coupled with support from CI and GEF, ensures that the foundation being
			laid today will contribute to a greener, more resilient Greenville tomorrow. In the months ahead, the focus will be on strengthening
			systems, supporting the enterprise, and increasing public awareness through radio programs and school-led campaigns.<br><br>
			
			The story of Greenville’s transformation is a story of shared action; proof that when local partnerships align with national vision,
			a cleaner and more sustainable future is not just imaginable, it’s achievable.

			<h1><b>From Classrooms to Climate Champions: Nurturing the Next Generation of Climate Leaders in Sinoe</b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 Inside classrooms across Sinoe County, a quiet but powerful movement is taking shape. Young Liberians are learning what climate
			 change truly means for their communities and discovering that they have a role to play in shaping a more sustainable future. Through
			 the Sinoe Building Climate Resilience Project (SBCRP), hundreds of students are no longer just studying the environment; they are
			 becoming climate champions.<br>
				Launched by BASA Development Initiatives (BDI) in partnership with Conservation International (CI) and supported by
				the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the project aims to enhance climate literacy, promote sustainable waste management,
				and restore fragile ecosystems. At the heart of this effort is an ambitious goal: to directly train 500 students who will
				go on to establish and lead climate clubs in ten high schools across the county, eventually cascading their knowledge to
				an additional 1,000 students.<br>
				
				So far, 328 of the 500 students have already completed their training sessions, which are led directly by BDI project staff.
				These sessions are interactive and practical, focusing on the basics of climate science, local environmental challenges,
				and how students can take collective action through tree planting, waste segregation, and peer education.
			 </p><br><br>
			 
			 <h1><b>Teachers and Journalists Join the Journey</b></h1>
			 <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 BDI has also trained 100 teachers and six journalists who will serve as mentors and amplifiers of climate awareness.
			 The teachers are helping to integrate climate literacy into classroom discussions, while the journalists are producing
			 radio programs and dramas in local languages to reach wider audiences. This synergy between schools and media is creating
			 a strong platform for community-level education and behavior change.<br><br>
				According to field updates, ten climate clubs are expected to be fully operational by the first or second week of November.
				These clubs will act as the backbone of the youth movement, organizing environmental campaigns, leading school-based tree
				planting, and documenting climate stories from their communities.<br><br>
			 </p>
			 
			 
			 <h1><b>Human Stories That Inspire Change</b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 During the initial baseline activities, one student, Ma. Juah Wilson from St. Joseph Catholic High School stood out for her enthusiasm.
			 Despite being told she might not be included in the survey due to her grade level, she pleaded for a chance to participate.
			 Her curiosity and commitment touched the team, and her thoughtful answers reflected the genuine passion that many students feel
			 toward protecting their environment.<br>
			 Her story is just one example of how the project is igniting a new wave of youth leadership in climate action. Students
			 are not waiting for change to come from elsewhere; they are stepping forward as messengers, advocates, and doers in their
			 schools and communities.<br><br>
			 </p>
			 
			 
			 <h1><b>Alignment with Liberia’s ARREST Agenda</b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			The SBCRP directly supports Liberia’s ARREST Agenda, particularly under the pillars of Resilience and Education.
			By fostering climate-conscious students and teachers, the project strengthens local capacity to adapt to environmental
			change and build sustainable systems that can outlast project timelines. It also enhances the culture of accountability
			and knowledge-sharing envisioned in Liberia’s development goals.<br><br>
			 </p>
			 

			 <h1><b>A Growing Movement with National Significance</b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			The results in Sinoe are only at the beginning. When the climate clubs become fully functional in November,
			students will begin leading awareness drives and tree planting across school grounds and nearby communities.
			These actions will contribute to the project’s larger goal of planting 5,000 trees and building climate-resilient
			mindsets across the county.<br><br>
			
			Through education, mentorship, and partnership, the Sinoe Building Climate Resilience Project is not only improving knowledge
			but also transforming mindsets. Every trained student, every engaged teacher, and every informed journalist becomes part of a
			growing movement — one that is preparing Liberia’s next generation to lead the fight for climate resilience from the classroom
			to the community.<br><br>

			<h1><b>Period Poverty in Africa: Addressing Menstrual Hygiene through BDI Support</b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 In many parts of Africa, a silent crisis affects millions of women and girls every month. Period poverty, a term used to
			 describe the lack of access to affordable and hygienic menstrual products, is a pressing issue that hampers the lives of
			 countless individuals.<br>
				According to a recent investigation by the BBC, the problem is especially severe in countries like Ghana,
				where women on the minimum wage are forced to allocate a significant portion of their earnings to purchase sanitary pads.
				This distressing reality highlights the urgent need for support and change.<br>
			 </p><br><br>
			 
			 <h1><b>The Challenge of Period Poverty</b></h1>
			 <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 The BBC conducted a survey across nine African countries to evaluate the affordability of period products for women living on minimum wages.<br><br>
				The research revealed that women in Ghana, for instance, must allocate up to 13% of their monthly salary to acquire two packets
				of sanitary towels. This financial burden is exacerbated by the rising costs of these essential products, driven in part by taxes
				and other factors.<br>
				Joyce, a 22-year-old Ghanaian, is one of many women whose life is impacted by period poverty. Unable to afford sanitary pads, she found
				herself in a harrowing situation where she felt compelled to exchange sexual favors for money to purchase the pads she needed.
				Joyce’s story underscores the desperation and vulnerability that period poverty subjects women to.<br><br>

			 <h1><b>Taxation and Menstrual Hygiene</b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 One key factor contributing to period poverty is the taxation of menstrual products. Many activists argue that eliminating
			 taxes on these essential items is crucial to making them more accessible to all women.<br><br>
			 “Tampon taxes,” which encompass various taxes imposed on feminine hygiene products, hinder women’s ability to afford sanitary pads.
			 In Kenya, for example, the removal of such taxes resulted in a significant reduction in pad prices.<br>
			 Campaigners emphasize that these products should not be seen as luxury items subject to high taxes, but rather as basic
			 necessities that all women require. Efforts to exempt these products from taxation, as seen in countries like Kenya and
			 South Africa, play a pivotal role in easing the financial burden on women.<br>
			 </p>
			 
			 
			 <h1><b>Alignment with Liberia’s ARREST Agenda</b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			In the face of this distressing reality, organizations like BASA Development Initiatives (BDI) are stepping up to
			address period poverty in Africa. BDI’s ongoing menstrual hygiene campaign in Liberia serves as an exemplary effort
			to tackle this issue.<br>
			By raising awareness, providing educational programs, gathering data, and distributing sanitary products,
			BDI is making strides toward improving menstrual hygiene among women and girls in Liberia.<br>
			But the problem is not confined to Liberia or Ghana alone. The BBC’s research indicates that 500 million women worldwide
			lack access to menstrual products, and this scarcity is often coupled with inadequate facilities for proper menstrual
			hygiene management. This is a global crisis that requires attention, action, and support.<br><br>
			 </p>
			 

			 <h1><b>A Call to Action</b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			The battle against period poverty requires collective efforts. BDI’s campaign in Liberia is a prime example
			of how organizations can make a tangible difference in women’s lives by sanitary products are accessible,
			safe, and affordable. <br><br>
			
			You can make a difference by supporting BDI’s menstrual hygiene campaign in Liberia. Your contributions will
			help provide essential menstrual products to women and girls who would otherwise struggle to access them.
			By contributing to this cause, you contribute to women’s health, dignity, and overall well-being.<br><br>
			 </p>
			 
			
			<h1><b>Conclusion</b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			Period poverty is an urgent issue that demands attention, action, and collaboration. The findings from the
			BBC’s research shed light on the struggles that countless women face each month due to the lack of affordable
			menstrual products. <br><br>
			
			BDI’s ongoing menstrual hygiene campaign in Liberia exemplifies how organizations can drive change and improve women’s lives.
			Additionally, efforts to eliminate taxes on menstrual products are critical to making them accessible to all. By supporting
			BDI’s campaign, you can play a crucial role in addressing period poverty and advancing menstrual hygiene across Africa.<br><br>

			 <b>Monrovia-</b> BASA Development Initiatives in partnership with Catholic Relief Services other organizations on 11 July 2023 began research
			 into menstrual hygiene in Monsterrado, Bong, and Grand Basa Counties.<br><br>
				According to our CEO Katherina Hopkins who leads the BDI team, the search aims at identifying challenges faced by young women especially school
				those of school-going age. The data from the research will be used to raise funds and provide support in an effort to end period poverty in Liberia.
				Period poverty refers to the lack of access to menstrual hygiene products, facilities, education, and information, affecting menstruating
				individuals. In Liberia, period poverty remains a significant challenge.<br>
			 </p><br><br>
			 
			 <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 Liberia faces various socio-economic challenges, including a lack of infrastructure and limited access to essential services.
			 In such circumstances, menstrual hygiene management becomes a significant concern for many women and girls. Factors contributing
			 to period poverty in Liberia include limited access to sanitary products, cultural taboos and stigma surrounding menstruation,
			 inadequate sanitation facilities, and a lack of education and awareness.<br><br>
				BDI is one of the major organizations seeking to address period poverty in Liberia. The goal is to provide access to affordable
				and sustainable menstrual hygiene products, promote education and awareness on menstruation, and improve sanitation facilities
				in schools and communities.<br>

			<h1><b>Nourishing Minds: School Feeding in Liberia for a Brighter Future </b></h1>
			<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 Access to quality education is a fundamental right for every child, but hunger remains a significant barrier to
			 learning in Liberia. Our fundraising initiative seeks to address this critical issue by providing nutritious meals to
			 students in schools across the country.<br><br>
				Ensuring that children have enough to eat can create a foundation for learning, improve attendance, and contribute
				to developing a healthier and more prosperous nation.<br>
			 </p><br>
			 
			 <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 <b>The School Feeding Challenge:</b>
			 Malnutrition and hunger hinder a child’s ability to learn and perpetuate a cycle of poverty. Two out of every five children
			 in Liberia lacks meals. Over 50% of Liberian students in Liberia attend school on empty stomachs, compromising their concentration,
			 cognitive development, and overall well-being.<br><br>
				<b>Our Vision for this Cause:</b> We envision a Liberia where every child can receive an education without hunger.
				By implementing a school feeding program, we aim to create an environment where students can thrive academically,
				physically, and emotionally. BDI also seeks to impact agricultural knowledge to students to increase their aspirations
				in agriculture and agribusiness.<br><br>
			 </p>
			 
			 			 <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 <b>Our Strategy:</b>
				Our school feeding initiative focuses on three strategic pillars:<br>
				1. Nutrition and Health: BDI believes nourished students are better learners. By providing nutritious meals that meet dietary standards,
				we contribute to improved health, cognitive function, and overall well-being among students.<br><br>
			<b>Education and Attendance:</b> A full stomach improves attendance and classroom engagement. Our program aims to increase school
			enrollment and reduce dropout rates by addressing hunger as an educational barrier.<br><br>
				<b>School Garden-</b> BDI seeks to develop school gardens for schools and train students in good agricultural practices,
				climate-smart agriculture, and post-harvest loss.<br><br>
				<b>Community Engagement:</b> BDI understands that a holistic approach is essential. We will collaborate with parents, teachers,
				and local communities to ensure the program’s sustainability and promote nutritional education.<br>
			 </p>
			 
			 <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:26px;">
			 <b>How You Can Make a Difference:</b>
				Your support is instrumental in creating a brighter future for Liberian children. By contributing to our initiative,
				you are investing in: <b>Nutrition:</b> Providing nutritious meals that support children’s growth and development.
				<b>Education:</b> Improving school attendance, participation, and academic outcomes.
				
				<b>Community Well-Being:</b> Fostering a sense of community and promoting healthier lifestyles.<br><br>
				<b>Join Our Mission:</b> Together, we can break Liberia’s hunger and illiteracy cycle. Your donation will be
				a stepping stone toward a future where every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.<br>
